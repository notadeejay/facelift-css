## General Layout and Responsiveness

- The general layout and responsiveness of the page should remain the same as it is now. This is not 100% reflected in the CSS right now. I've added media queries for particular items that required alternate layouts but did not include them for the general layout of the lesson page. 

## Fonts

- Need the following font weights:
    - **Lato**
        - 400, 400 italic, 600, 600 italic, 700, 800, 900
    - **Open Sans**
        - 400, 400 italic, 600, 700, 800
