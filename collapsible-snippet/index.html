            <p>1.&nbsp;According to the<em> if </em>statement, if the price per night is less than $150, then the program will set the message to &quot;This accommodation is&nbsp;affordable for the Brooklyn neighborhood&quot; and then execute the second nested if-statement. According to the nested if-statement, if the room is either a &quot;Private room&quot; or an &quot;Entire home/apt&quot;, the program should print &quot;This {room_type} is affordable for {neighborhood}. You should book it.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
            
            <p>In the example above, you started with a price per night of $149 and a &quot;Private room&quot;. So your code should print:</p>
            
            <pre>
            <code class="language-markdown">This Private room is affordable for Brooklyn. You should book it.</code></pre>
            
            <p>2.&nbsp;According to the<em> if </em>statement, if the price per night is under $150, then your program will set the message to &quot;This accommodation is&nbsp;affordable for Brooklyn&quot; and continue on to evaluate nested if-statement. If the second if-statement is False, it will execute the statement below the else-statement.&nbsp;Setting message equal to&nbsp;&quot;This accommodation is affordable, but it isn&#39;t the right type&quot;</p>
            
            <p>In the example below, the price per night is $149&nbsp;and the room type is &quot;Shared&quot;.</p>
            
            <pre>
            <code class="language-markdown">This accommodation is affordable, but it isn't the right type.</code></pre>
            
            <p>3.&nbsp;According to the<em> if </em>statement, if the price per night is not under&nbsp;$150, then your program will skip right to the else-statement, and set the message to &quot;This accommodation is&nbsp;not within your budget&quot; before printing it</p>
            
            <p>In the example below, the price per night is $160&nbsp;and the room type is &quot;Private room&quot;.</p>
            
            <pre>
            <code class="language-markdown">This accommodation is outside of your budget.</code></pre>
            
            <p>You full solution should look similar to this:</p>
            
            <pre>
            <code class="language-python">if price_per_night &lt; 150:
