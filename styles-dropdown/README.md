## Implementation Considerations

- Implemented through the CKEditor Styles plugin
- Any existing styles that are simply being updated should keep the same class names so they will auto-update on release.

### Existing styles to be removed include:

- fancy blockquote 
- green word
- blue word
- red word
- purple word
- spoiler 

### Existing styles to be updated:

- All callouts
