<h3>4. Blockquotes</h3>
<blockquote class="callout bq"><p>"You smart, you loyal, you a genius. Celebrate success right, the only way, apple. Give thanks to the most high. To succeed you must believe. When you believe, you will succeed. You should never complain, complaining is a weak emotion, you got life, we breathing, we blessed. Look at the sunset, life is amazing, life is beautiful, life is what you make it."</p></blockquote>
