## Tables

- Need to be editable by LXD
- Should be able to add `default-table` class to the Table Tools CKEditor add-on that can be removed by LXDs (should they need to)
- There is CSS for tables inside of different elements:
    - To make it white on the lab or KC blocks
    - To adjust padding when in the lab sidebar
